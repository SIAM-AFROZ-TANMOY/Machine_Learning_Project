## 🌐 Overview

**Phishing URL Detection using Neural Networks** is a cybersecurity and machine learning project focused on the detection of **phishing and malicious URLs** using intelligent learning-based approaches.

Phishing attacks use deceptive websites that imitate legitimate online services to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, banking credentials, and personal data.

Traditional blacklist-based systems mainly depend on previously identified malicious URLs. This creates a major challenge when attackers generate **new or previously unseen phishing URLs**.

Our project explores how **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and Transformer-based models** can provide more intelligent and adaptive phishing detection.

> **The goal is not simply to recognize known threats — it is to explore how AI can learn the patterns behind malicious URLs.**

The motivation and problem statement are based on the project presentation, which highlights the limitations of traditional blacklist methods against newly emerging phishing websites.

# 🚨 Why Phishing Detection Matters

A phishing website can be visually similar to a legitimate website while secretly attempting to steal user information.

### The traditional approach

```text
User enters URL
       │
       ▼
Blacklist Lookup
       │
   ┌───┴────┐
   │        │
Known     Unknown
Threat     URL
   │        │
   ▼        ▼
Block     May Pass
```

The major weakness is that **new phishing URLs may not yet exist in a blacklist**.

### The AI-based vision

```text
                 URL
                  │
                  ▼
          Feature / Pattern Analysis

# 🔬 Research Gap Analysis

Despite significant progress, current phishing detection systems still face several challenges.

## 1. 🕵️ Unseen Phishing URLs

Models may struggle when attackers introduce URL patterns that were not represented in the training data.

## 2. 📅 Outdated or Imbalanced Data

Phishing attacks continuously evolve, while datasets may not always reflect the latest attack patterns.

## 3. 🌐 Limited Context

URL-only analysis may not fully capture information contained within the actual webpage.

## 4. ⚙️ Computational Complexity

Large and sophisticated deep learning models can require considerable computational resources.

## 5. 🔍 Limited Interpretability

A model may identify a URL as malicious without clearly explaining **why** it made that decision.

These five issues are explicitly identified in the project's research-gap analysis.

---

# 🚀 Proposed Research Improvements

Our project identifies several promising directions for improving future phishing detection systems.

## 🌐 01 — Multimodal AI

Instead of relying only on the URL, a future system could analyze multiple sources of information:

```text
                    Website
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        ▼              ▼              ▼
       URL            HTML          Visual
        │              │              │
        ▼              ▼              ▼
     Domain         Structure      Screenshot
     Pattern        Content        Logo
                                  Login Page
        │              │              │
        └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                       ▼
                Multimodal Model
                       │
                       ▼
              Phishing / Legitimate
```

Potential inputs include:

* URL
* HTML
* Images
* Logo
* Screenshot
* Login-page design
* SSL certificate
* JavaScript behavior

This direction is proposed in the project's improvement analysis.

---

# 🔄 02 — Continual Learning

Attackers constantly develop new phishing techniques.

A future system could continuously incorporate newly observed data.

```text
       New Phishing Attack
                │
                ▼
          New Training Data
                │
                ▼
         Continual Learning
                │
                ▼
          Updated Model
                │
                ▼
       Better Threat Detection
                │
                └───────────────↺
```

This could help models adapt to evolving threats instead of remaining dependent on an old training distribution.

The presentation proposes continual learning for more adaptive zero-day phishing detection.

---

# 🧠 03 — Explainable AI (XAI)

An effective security system should ideally provide more than a binary prediction.

Instead of:

```text
URL → PHISHING ❌
```

a future system could provide:

```text
URL → PHISHING ❌

Reasons:
├── Suspicious URL structure
├── Abnormal domain characteristics
├── Unusual redirection pattern
└── Suspicious webpage behavior
```

Explainable AI can help security professionals understand and investigate model decisions.

---

# 🌍 04 — Multilingual & Unicode URL Detection

Modern phishing attacks can exploit:

* Unicode characters
* Internationalized domain names
* Visually similar characters
* Multilingual URLs

Future research should therefore evaluate model robustness across different languages and Unicode-based URL manipulations.

---

# 🕸️ 05 — Graph Neural Networks

A URL does not exist in isolation.

Future systems could model relationships between:

```text
             Domain
            /      \
           /        \
       IP Address   DNS
           \        /
            \      /
          Certificate
                │
                ▼
        Related Domains
```

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** could potentially help analyze relationships among domains, IP addresses, DNS information, certificates, and related infrastructure.

---

# 🛡️ 06 — Adversarial Robustness

Attackers can deliberately modify URLs to evade machine learning systems.

Future work can investigate **adversarial training** to make phishing detection models more robust against manipulated URLs.

The presentation specifically proposes multilingual support, GNN-based domain/IP relationship analysis, and adversarial training as future research directions.
